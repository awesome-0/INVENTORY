# Project Title

This is a really basic app that helps merchants keep track of their goods

## Getting Started

It's really simple to start with. It helps merchants, store owners or practically anyone who is into selling of goods 
to keep track of their goods by taking a picture, adding a price tag and quantities available
there is a sell button that reduces the quantit by 1 everytime its pressed.
You can also order for more by just suplying the quantity needed and the email of the supplier of the exact good you want supplied.
and all of this information is stored in a database so your information is safe.
You can also delete any product you want..


just download the app from here
